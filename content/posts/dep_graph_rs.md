Navigating the tangled web of a massive Rust crate can feel like exploring a dark maze without a guide.
Sure `rust-analyzer` gives you some hints, but what if you want a bird's-eye view of how everything connects?

[`dep_graph_rs`](https://github.com/PSeitz/dep_graph_rs) comes to the rescue! 
It's a command-line tool that generates a dependency graph for the internal dependencies of your Rust crate. 
Vivid dependency graphs at your fingertips!

## How does it work?

It parses source code using the [`syn`](https://github.com/dtolnay/syn) crate, 
analyzes all the `use crate` statements, tries to find & parse the files they belong to, and builds a directed graph of 
how everything is connected. 

The output is in a [DOT](https://graphviz.org/doc/info/lang.html) graph, ready for visualization. 
For now at least, maybe later some more CLI friendly output?

## A Real-World Example

I was looking at the 
[`tantivy`](https://github.com/quickwit-oss/tantivy) crate and thinking about extracting the `directory` 
module into its own, separate crate. Before doing that, I wanted a map of its dependencies. 
Like a treasure map, but for code!

We can generate a graph of just the dependencies going outwards from the `directory` module:

```bash
dep_graph_rs path/to/tantivy --source "directory.*" > tantivy_directory_deps.dot
```

And voil√†! This command produces a `.dot` file that can be rendered into this fantastically beautiful graph:

![Fantastically beautiful graph for the tantivy 'directory' module](/example_dep_graph.png)

{% info() %}
Yes, this graph indeed has <span class="rainbow">colors</span>! We really live in the future.
{% end %}


There are two constants, `META_FILEPATH` and `MANAGED_FILEPATH` in `core`, that maybe could be moved into the `directory` module?
To find out, we can create a new graph that only shows these two items:

```bash
dep_graph_rs path/to/tantivy/ --item "META_FILEPATH|MANAGED_FILEPATH" | xclip -selection clipboard
```

![META_FILEPATH and MANAGED_FILEPATH  dependency graph](/example_dep_graph2.png)

Now we can see that these two constants have some unexpected dependencies, 
which might complicate the extraction of the `directory` module into its own crate.

## Features

*   **Generates dependency graphs** from your Rust source code.
*   **Outputs in DOT format**, so you can use it with awesome tools like Graphviz.
*   **Group dependencies** by file or by module.
*   **Filter the graph** by source, destination, or even the specific item being imported (like a function or struct).
*   **Clusters nodes** by their root module for a cleaner, more readable graph.

## How to Use It

First, install it with `cargo`:

```bash
cargo install dep_graph_rs
```

Then, just run it from your crate's root directory:

```bash
dep_graph_rs > graph.dot
```

This will output the dependency graph in DOT format into a file named `graph.dot`.

To render the graph, you have a couple of options:

1.  **Online:** The quickest way is to copy the contents of `graph.dot` and paste them into an online viewer like [GraphvizOnline](https://dreampuf.github.io/GraphvizOnline/).
2.  **Local:** If you have [Graphviz](https://graphviz.org/) installed, you can render it to an image yourself: `dot -Tpng graph.dot -o graph.png`

### Powerful Filtering

You can slice and dice the graph to only show what you care about.

*   `--mode <MODE>`: Group by `file` or `module` (the default).
*   `--source <SOURCE>`: Only show dependencies from a specific module.
*   `--destination <DESTINATION>`: Only show dependencies pointing to a specific module.
*   `--item <ITEM>`: Filter by the name of the imported item (e.g., a function or struct).

{% info() %}
`source`, `destination`, and `item` filters are exact matches, except if they contain regex characters, in which case they are treated as regex patterns.
{% end %}

## Limitations & Disclaimer
This tool is still in its early stages, so expect some rough edges.

Glob dependencies (`*`) are not correctly handled yet, so if you have `use crate::mega_module::*;`, it will not resolve the actual items being used here.

Exceedingly large unfiltered graphs can be overwhelming for your brain and your computer.
